# Red-Alerts-Analyze - Data Science Project

Since 2014 has been over 23,000 alerts in Israel.
In our project we want to explore and analyze the data
and we want to answer the questions: 

Is it possible to classify the areas in Israel according to the number of alerts that have been in recent years?
Or is it possible to find cities with similar characteristics and different geographical location?

To answer these questions we did a number of steps:

1. Crawling - with Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
2. Data Handling.
3. EDA.
4. Machine learning - Unsupervised Learning.
5. conclusions.

Here's some photos from the project :
